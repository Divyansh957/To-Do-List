# To-Do List Web Application

A simple, accessible, and responsive To-Do List web app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Tasks persist in browser localStorage. Use this as a starting point and optionally add authentication, server storage, or convert to a framework (React/Vue).

## Features
- Add tasks
- Edit tasks (inline)
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks completed / active
- Filter: All / Active / Completed
- Clear completed tasks
- Persist tasks in browser localStorage
- Keyboard friendly: Enter to add, Enter to save edits, Esc to cancel edit

## Files
- `index.html` — markup and UI
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `app.js` — JavaScript logic and localStorage
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run locally
1. Save all files in a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge).
3. Start adding tasks.

No build tools or servers required.

## Deployment options
- GitHub Pages — push files to a repo and enable Pages for the `main` branch (root).
- Netlify — drag-and-drop the folder or connect a repo for continuous deploy.
- Vercel — import the repo and deploy (static).
- Firebase Hosting / Surge / Docker — also possible.

If you want, I can:
- Initialize a Git repo and push to your GitHub account (tell me repo name and visibility).
- Deploy the site to GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel for you.
